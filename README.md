Project Background
For this project, a survey was conducted to assess the impact of music on people's mental health and mood in general. The survey recorded responses from over 700 participants and includes details like musical preferences, listening habits, and overall state of mind. Respondents were given 16 genres of music for which they ranked the frequency of listening to each. The responses ranged from never, to very frequently.
